I'm Claude Code, ready to help you build React dashboards for Living Apps Backend. I've read the project instructions and I'm aware of the critical constraints:\n\n**Key Points I've Noted:**\n- Users are non-technical - I need to interpret vague requests and create beautiful, functional solutions\n- Always design first (frontend-design skill), then implement (frontend-impl skill)\n- Must analyze `app_metadata.json` to understand available data\n- Strict API rules around dates, applookup fields, and response handling\n- TypeScript type-only imports required\n- Deployment via MCP tool only\n\n**My Workflow:**\n1. Understand the user's actual need (not just literal request)\n2. Analyze app metadata for available data/relationships\n3. Create detailed design brief with KPIs, visualizations, layouts, and theme\n4. Implement Dashboard.tsx following the design exactly\n5. Build and deploy via `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n**Current Mode:** I'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode** - I can explore the codebase and design plans, but I cannot create or modify files in this session.\n\nI'm ready to help! What dashboard would you like to create for your Living Apps data?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1760,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1760,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXrZopgiRgwRExgnjqTYu","type":"assistant","uuid":"e5d0c7b3-2ee9-4aea-bbae-fe36ddd77878","timestamp":"2026-02-06T09:19:11.809Z"}
