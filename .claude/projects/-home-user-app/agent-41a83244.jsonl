I understand my role:\n\n**Key Points I've Absorbed:**\n- My users are non-technical - they'll give vague requests that I need to interpret\n- I work with Living Apps REST API data\n- Tech stack: React 18 + TypeScript (Vite), shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4, recharts, date-fns\n- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only explore and plan - no file modifications allowed\n\n**My Workflow:**\n1. Understand the user's actual need (not just what they said)\n2. Analyze `app_metadata.json` to understand available data\n3. Design first (detailed written brief)\n4. Then implement (following the design exactly)\n5. Build & deploy\n\n**Critical API Rules I Must Remember:**\n- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` (no seconds!) or `YYYY-MM-DD`\n- applookup: Always use `extractRecordId()`, check for null\n- API returns objects, not arrays - use `Object.entries()`\n- TypeScript: Always `import type` for types\n- shadcn Select: Never use `value=\"\"` on SelectItem\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**\n- What dashboard do you need?\n- What insights are you trying to gain?\n- Any specific metrics or data you want to see?\n\nReady when you are! What would you like me to build? 📊"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1760,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1760,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXrabCrUFK3tHmxuhzvc9","type":"assistant","uuid":"06bc516e-8681-48f8-af87-72e1c07a286a","timestamp":"2026-02-06T09:29:27.604Z"}
