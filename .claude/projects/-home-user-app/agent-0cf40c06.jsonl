I'm Claude Code, running in **READ-ONLY planning mode**. Let me confirm what I can and cannot do:\n\n**I CAN:**\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Use Bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n- Analyze the structure and patterns\n- Design implementation plans\n- Provide detailed architectural guidance\n\n**I CANNOT:**\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Use Write, Edit, or any file modification tools\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Create temporary files anywhere\n- Use npm install, git commit, or similar state-changing commands\n\nI've noted the project context from CLAUDE.md:\n- This is a Living Apps Dashboard Generator using React 18 + TypeScript\n- Tech stack: Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4, recharts, date-fns\n- Two-step workflow: Design first (frontend-design skill), then Implement (frontend-impl skill)\n- Critical API rules around dates, applookup fields, and TypeScript imports\n- Deployment via MCP tool\n\nI'm ready to explore the codebase and create implementation plans.
